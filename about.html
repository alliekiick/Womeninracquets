  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>Hi, my name is Allie Kiick.</p>

  <p>I’m a former professional tennis player whose career was cut short by knee injuries—something that felt devastating at the time but ultimately led me to a new and powerful path. I transitioned into the world of teaching and leadership in racquet sports, and what I quickly noticed was... where are all the women?</p>

  <p>This industry is full of passion, strategy, excellence—and yet, women are still vastly underrepresented in leadership roles like Head Racquet Professionals, Directors of Racquets, and General Managers. And I’m here to say: that needs to change.</p>

  <p>We are smart. We are capable. We are leaders. And it’s time we took our place at the top.</p>

  <p><strong>The Directors’ Circle – Women in Racquet Sports</strong> was created for one reason: to empower, educate, and elevate women in this industry. Whether you're just starting your journey or already leading programs, this community is here to support you every step of the way.</p>

  <p>We’re building a circle of women who:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Want to lead with confidence</li>
    <li>Support each other in a male-dominated field</li>
    <li>Learn and grow from industry experts</li>
    <li>Share insights, strategies, and job opportunities</li>
    <li>Believe that our voices <em>belong</em> in the boardroom and on the court</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is your space. A bold, inclusive, and energizing platform where your ambition is celebrated, your voice is heard, and your future is fueled.</p>

  <p>We’re not just here to network — we’re here to make real change. To break barriers. To rewrite the playbook. And to do it together.</p>

  <p><strong>Let’s make waves together.</strong></p>
